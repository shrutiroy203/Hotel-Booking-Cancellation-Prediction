# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction

Hello there! I am a Masters student in Data science, at University of San Francisco. In my free time I love travelling and playing with data!

Once during my trip, I had an interesting conversation with a BnB owner who mentioned how people cancelling at the last moment was affecting her. When I came across this data, I immediately recalled that conversation and thought - is there a way to pre-emptively identify if a user is going to cancel their booking? This can help hotel/BnB owners save a lot of money and utilities! 

I acquired the data from Hotel Booking Datasets (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191). I used Random Forest, Regularised Logistic Regression and XgBoost to identify whether a booking will get cancelled or not. In the end I got 88.7% balanced F1 score on test dataset.

Here is the notebook (https://deepnote.com/project/aa268a46-3542-4a0a-85f2-14c43bc3e6e2). I hope you find this project as interesting as I did!
