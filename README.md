## Hello there! I am a Masters student in Data science, at University of San Francisco. In my free time I love travelling and playing with data!

TL;DR Here is the [project code](https://deepnote.com/project/aa268a46-3542-4a0a-85f2-14c43bc3e6e2#%2FHotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction%2FHotel%20Booking%20Cancellation%20Prediction.ipynb)

In Covid era, the world economy was hit. A large part was the travel industry which included hotels, as they faced a large number of cancellations. But cancellations is a problem that Hotels have been facing since a long time. It can become a big sunk cost for the hotels when a person cancels at the last moment:

When I came across the booking [data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191), the first thought that I had was: is there a way to pre-emptively identify if a user is going to cancel their booking? This can help hotel/BnB owners save a lot of money and utilities!

### Any data science project consists of four steps:

I used the data from [Hotel Booking Datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191). 

### Models used in the project
1. Random Forest
2. Regularised Logistic Regression
3. XgBoost

### Feature Importance

Permutation Importance has been used to establish feature importance in the chosen model

### Lets get started! 
Here is the [notebook](https://deepnote.com/project/aa268a46-3542-4a0a-85f2-14c43bc3e6e2#%2FHotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction%2FHotel%20Booking%20Cancellation%20Prediction.ipynb). I used Random Forest, Regularised Logistic Regression and XgBoost to identify the propensity of a booking getting cancelled. After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, I was able to predict the cancelation with 88.7% accuracy. I hope you find this project as interesting as I did!
